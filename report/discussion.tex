\section{Discussion}
%talk about fluorescence maybe
%talk about the next steps, what's to do: check the abundances or check with models. Cite some articles(check the word document). See how many photons would be expected. 
% would be cool to put limits on processes: charge-exchange, fluorescence of heavy elements etc...

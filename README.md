Week 1 :    Installed oda-api package. Encountered some troubles with pyerfa as it needed MS Visual C++ in a weird way. Managed to do it with some googling help.
            Created a virtual environment with all useful packages: spacetech_env
            Began the tutorial up to the end of the "Quickstar".
Week 2 :    Continued tutorial:
            1. In Quickstart : encountered some trouble with the LC plot. Error: "no instrument". Changed the format but looks useless to define lc variable now...
            2. Couldn't plot with POLAR instrument.

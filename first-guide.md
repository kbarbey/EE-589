## Instructions on how to start working on the project

* Make notes every time you do something, even if it's small. Write something down every day, even if it's couple of sentences about what you managed, what are the difficulties, and what you plan to do next. It will us seeing the prorgess, identify blocking issues. The notes also can be the basis for the report
  * Try to make an overleaf repository and connect to this github repository
* We aim to meet once a week starting from the week of Feb 20 (the best day is to be selected). On Feb 20 we will at least discuss on zoom, or hopefully meet in person.
* In principle there is some space for students at LASTRO and SCITAS - to be determined.
